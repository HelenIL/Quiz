# Quiz
The goal of this assignment was to create a quiz with a countdown timer and a high score feature. The quiz should begin with a start button followed by the questions and answers. Every wrong answer should subtract time from the clock. The quiz ends when the time runs out or all questions are answered. High scores should be stored.
